   #2.	A study has shown that playing a musical instrument helps in increasing one's IQ by 7 points. 
 #Chef knows he can't beat Einstein in physics, but he wants to try to beat him in an IQ competition. 
 #Given that Einsteinâ€™s IQ is170, and Chef currently has an IQ of X. Determine if, after learning to play
 #a musical instrument, Chef's IQ will become strictly greater than Einstein's. Print "Yes" if it is 
 #possible for Chef to beat Einstein, else print "No" (without quotes).
