#  An anagram of a word is a word that is created by rearranging the letters of the
# original. For instance, two anagrams of idle are deli and lied. Finding anagrams that
# are real words is beyond our reach until the chapter on text files. Instead, write a
# program that asks the user for a string and returns a random anagram of the stringâ€”
# in other words, a random rearrangement of the letters of that string.
